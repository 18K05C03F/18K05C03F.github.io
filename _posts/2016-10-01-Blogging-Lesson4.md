    <td>I learnt by going back to w3schools to find and edit my blog page to make it look better. I also asked other people how to change certain things like how to change the opacity of the container where the table is in. I also searched up which colour schemes worked well together so I could make my website look more professional. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Things which limited my learning included not knowing how to change certain aspects of my blog and not knowing where to find it on the internet and w3schools. The habit I need to learn on is  independence as I needed to ask someone to help me instead of me searching it on the internet.</td>

    <td>Next time I will try to be more independent and work things out for myself instead of asking other people around me. </td>
