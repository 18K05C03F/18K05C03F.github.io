    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>A slight understanding of repl.it and its functions</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To go through the worksheet and complete the tasks to enhance our understanding of repl.it and use it to form code to solve problems.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes - because I managed to complete many of the task in reasonable time and with an understanding of what was going on. In addition, I was able to overcome some of the problems i faced when creating my code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson I learn how and when to use if and if else loops to make my code clearer and easier to follow. Also I learnt how to solve problems by converting the code from pseudocode to python and then putting it into repl.it. In addition, I learn how to convert inputs to string and then to integer/float and possibly even back again. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things which limited my learning was that I didn't take notes when my teacher was talking meaning I forgot things which could have helped me later in the lesson to accomplish the task. In addition, I didn't ask the teacher for help and I didn't ask him questions to improve my work. Overall I think I need to work on the habit of questioning because it means I can use the teacher's advice to improve my work for another task. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will be more vocal and ask questions so that I get a better understanding in different areas of python and then later improve my work.</td>
