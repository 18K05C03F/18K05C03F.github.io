    <td>The things which limited my learning include, me not knowing how to edit certain parts of my table such as the top where the date and title is displayed. Therefore I need to work on the habit of accuracy and independence.</td>

    <td>Next time I will be searching up how to do/fix certain things except from just asking people. Also I will improve my learning by listening for the smaller details when Mr Keen is going through the instructions so I don't miss key details.</td>
