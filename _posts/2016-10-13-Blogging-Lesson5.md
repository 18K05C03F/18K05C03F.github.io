    <td>I learnt by listening to Mr Keen on how to use =vlookup in my Google Sheets document. A strategy I found effective was taking down specific pieces of code and then later on in the lesson incorporating it into my spreadsheet.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>During this lesson I didn't know how to do certain things on my spreadsheet so I had to either ask someone else and usually they didn't know either. However, overall in the lesson I achieved lots and I improved spreadsheet a lot.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will become more independent and use google to search things up instead of relying on others around me. Also I will ask Mr.Keen more questions and queries when it comes to my spreadsheet.</td>
