    <td>A strategy which was effective was taking down essential and useful pieces of code while Mr.Keen showed us what to do in the lesson and ways to improve our spreadsheet.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Things which limited my learning include not knowing what the code I have taken down does and where to put it inside my spreadsheet. Therefore I need to improve in my habit of accuracy as i need to improve in taking accurate notes for when I have to do it myself.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will take more detailed notes. For example, if I have taken down a piece of code next to it I will write down its significance and use so I don't forget later on in the lesson.</td>
