    <td>In this lesson, I learnt how to put a Google Doc onto Github.io using a program called Gabriel. The strategies I used include:
Listening to the teacher;
Understanding the instructions clearly;
Making notes as the teacher was talking.
In future lessons, I will be using these strategies to help me with making my website.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things which limited my learning include not taking down notes with sufficient detail which resulted in me having to ask questions to people next to me. Therefore I need to work on attention to detail which corresponds to the habit of accuracy meaning I need to work on that so I don't have to frequently ask questions.</td>

    <td>Next time I will take more detailed and descriptive notes meaning I can get the work done quicker and more effectively, also I need to be more independent so I don't distract others when asking questions.</td>
