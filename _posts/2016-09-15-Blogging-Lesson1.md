    <td>in this lesson i learnt how to put a google doc onto github.io using a program called gabriel. The strategies i used to use this as a piece of my learning included, listening to the teacher to understand the instructions clearly, made sure to make notes as Mr Keen was talking so i didn't forget and so i could use it for any later use in upcoming lessons.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>the things which limited my learning include not taking down notes with enough detail resulting in me having to ask questions to people next to me and i need to work on attention to detail as the habit i need to improve so i don't need to frequently ask questions.</td>

    <td>next time i will take more detailed and descriptive notes meaning i can get the work done quicker and more effectively, also i need to be more independent so i don't distract others.</td>
