    <td>I learnt by taking detailed notes of what my teacher was talking about and how to edit and customise my Github website resulting in me being able to improve my website.

    <td>The things which limited my learning was that I did not write down what every piece of code did and how to edit and customise them to my preference. This means that I need to work on habit of noticing and accuracy.</td>
