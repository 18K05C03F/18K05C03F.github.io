    <td>This lesson I learnt what was needed in my website/blog to achieve a high 7-9 grade. This included: multiple changes to my .yml and .scss; detailed description in my blog and a constructive and detailed reflection of the lesson in my blog. During the lesson Mr.Keen showed the class some of people's blogs so we could assess it as a class. This was helpful because it showed me how the blogs were going to be marked and to see if there were things which I could improve upon in my blog.</td>

    <td>During the lesson I feel I didnâ€™t grasp everything I could have from accessing other people's work. Therefore I feel I need to work on the habit of noticing because I feel that I could have been more attentive during the lesson and got more ideas on how to improve my website.</td>

    <td>Next time i will be more aware of what Mr.Keen is saying so I can improve my work. I will improve by not getting distracted easily and taking down descriptive notes.</td>
